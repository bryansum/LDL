# LDL
`LDL` is a simple iOS companion application I made to help me do [Leicht-Deutsch-Lernen](http://leicht-deutsch-lernen.com) exercises while on the go. That website offers a set of audio files and accompanying documents to help learn German by listening, repeating German as a native speaker would. This application reads those files and presents an easy-to-use interface for listening and reading at the same time.

To be clear, I have no affiliation with *Leicht-Deutsch-Lernen*, but wholeheartedly endorse their products.

## Setup

To start using the application, place lessons inside the `Documents` folder. You do this by attaching your phone to iTunes, and then dragging and dropping the folder for the lesson. `LDL` will read these files and present a nice interface + audio player for simulataneously viewing PDFs and listening to MP3s.
